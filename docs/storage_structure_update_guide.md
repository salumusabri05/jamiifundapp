# Storage Structure Change - No UUID Folders Required

We've simplified the file upload process for verification documents. Instead of requiring a specific folder structure with user UUID folders, files can now be uploaded directly to the root of the bucket.

## Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Storage Path**: Files are now uploaded directly to the bucket root instead of using user ID folders.

2. **Unique Filenames**: User IDs are now embedded in the filename itself to maintain uniqueness.

3. **Updated RLS Policies**: Storage policies have been updated to allow direct access to the bucket.

4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and bucket existence checks.

## Benefits:

- Simpler file path handling
- No need to worry about folder structure
- Reduced complexity in RLS policies
- More straightforward debugging and troubleshooting

## Technical Note:

This change may require you to:
1. Update your Supabase RLS policies using the included migration file
2. Apply the migration file to create the bucket if it doesn't exist
3. Test uploads with the updated file structure

If you encounter any issues, use the Diagnostics tool in the Verification Screen to verify the bucket exists and test your permissions.
